## **Product Requirements for Ideation App**


## Document Objectives

This document is intended to outline the project requirements for the Ideation App. It aims to provide all stakeholders - internal and external - with an understanding of the project scope and high-level feature set.

This document will likely be used in conjunction with the Project Initiation Document (PID).

Other technical documentation (for example, REST API technical docs) will follow on from this document.


## OverView

Our client believes there is an opportunity for a new app in the marketplace, and want to create a minimum viable product (MVP) version to test the proposition. The new app will be called **Ideation**, and enables users to easily create & save an idea - and add a reminder for a follow-up.

The app will use WordPress as the data source. A user will need to create an account via the website. Once registered, the user can login in via the app and be authenticated.

Upon successful user authentication, WordPress will expose the ideas created by the user.

**WordPress Site Considerations:**

1.  Open registration
2.  Users will need to default to _idea_managers _user role
3.  Access to the site should be locked to admin only
4.  Register meta fields as custom fields to the response
5.  Users can only see ideas they have created
6.  Authenticate users via the JSON Web Token

**App Considerations:**



1.  Needs to be available to both Android and iOS users
2.  Users able to read, create, edit & delete ideas, reminder text and reminder dates
3.  Users can dismiss reminders
4.  Ideas are automatically stored

**Registration**

Users will need to register on the site and create an account. Once registration has been completed and the user is created, they can use the same registration details within the app.

**Authentication**

WordPress will handle authentication via JSON Web Token (JWT) to authenticate users from WordPress into the app.

**Content Creation**

Users should be able to:

*   Create new ideas (including creating reminder text and date)
*   Edit existing ideas (including adding new reminder text and date)
*   Delete content (with a safety check alert)

Users will create content exclusively from the app (there will be no web interface other than registration).

Users can create a new ideas which map to an ideas CPT within WordPress.

**Data Structure** _(anatomy of an Idea)_:

*   Idea (maps to Title)
*   Author (current user ID)
*   Reminder Content (maps to custom meta field)
*   Reminder Date (maps to custom meta field)

## Risk Register
-----
* _Risk:_ The app fails to get accepted into the App Store
* _Impact Level:_ High
* _Likelihood:_ Low
* _Mitigation:_ We would expect to be provided with a reason why it had been rejected with clear actions required
-----
* _Risk: _ The app fails to find traction in the marketplace
* _Impact Level:_ High
* _Likelihood:_ Medium
* _Mitigation:_ This is an untested idea - the low-cost MVP will test the proposition
-----
* _Risk:_ A competitor releases a similar app
* _Impact Level:_ Medium
* _Likelihood:_ Medium
* _Mitigation:_ We would expect competitors to emerge as the app becomes successful - but rapid iteration would keep us ahead of the competition
-----
* _Risk:_ A pre-existing app adds the Ideation feature set
* _Impact Level:_ Medium
* _Likelihood:_ Medium
* _Mitigation:_ The single purpose focus and clarity of Ideation would provide an advantage over a bolt-on feature to an existing app
-----
* _Risk:_ Performance deteriorates as user increase
* _Impact Level:_ High
* _Likelihood:_ High
* _Mitigation:_ The stack would need to scale with usage
-----
* _Risk:_ Maintenance of two codebases could become challenging over time
* _Impact Level:_ Low
* _Likelihood:_ Medium
* _Mitigation:_ Communications channels need to be clearly established between the client, the agency and app maintenance agency
-----
* _Risk:_ The app costs more than anticipated
* _Impact Level:_ Medium
* _Likelihood:_ Low
* _Mitigation:_ Ever care has been taken to ensure an accurate cost estimate - but it is just an estimate. We would discuss together any required changes in funding level and agree mitigation
-----
* _Risk:_ The app developers misunderstand requirements within the documentation
* _Impact Level:_ Low
* _Likelihood:_ Low
* _Mitigation:_ Time will be provided to discuss and clarify this document
-----
